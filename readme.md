press releases, earnings, 3, 4   (no economy, general, governments, etc..... so just company specific if/when possible)

1. load   
2. study
3. extract earnings out of tables for each company

grab news from the 40 tickers?
grab news the "5 ways" as mentioned in Suzanne's email?
grab everything and then sift post facto?
